# Pong-w-AI

This is a basic pong game that includes 2 basic artificial intelligences.

The Dumb AI matches its paddle to the y coordinate of the ball, which is good in the beginning, but as the ball speeds up, this method becomes less efficient.

The Smart AI calculates the point that the ball will hit its side at by predicting the balls movement path and then saving the final y coordinate of the ball.
