# Pong-w-AI

This is a basic pong game that includes 2 basic artificial intelligences.

  *The Dumb AI matches its paddle to the y coordinate of the ball, which is good in the beginning, but as the ball speeds up, this method becomes less efficient.

  *The Smart AI calculates the point that the ball will hit its side at by predicting the balls movement path and then saving the final y coordinate of the ball.

  *Coded in JavaScript through the P5 Editor. P5 can be found at www.p5js.org.
